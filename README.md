# Avaya CMS Data Grabber
First off, know this code is rather old. It hasn't been touched since 2014.

It needs revitalization badly. Or buried?

Collects Avaya CMS call statistics every 3 seconds and pushes the
data to a SQL database. Up to 32 different Avaya/CMS servers can
be queried at the same time utilizing separate threads.
Originally written in VB.NET, it is my goal (with help) to port it 
to c#. 
# Editorial Mode: ON
No longer will be victims of the third-party companies!
They seem to have a "special" relationship with Avaya and have
access to their treasured API's (you and I do NOT).
# Editorial Mode: OFF
NOTE: This is NOT an API, but rather a glorified, invisible screen-
scraper that works rather nicely.
