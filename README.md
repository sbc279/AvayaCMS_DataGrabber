# AvayaCMS_DataGrabber
Collects Avaya CMS call statistics every 3 seconds and pushes the
data to a SQL database. Up to 32 different Avaya/CMS servers can
be queried at the same time utilizing separate threads.
Originally written in VB.NET, it is my goal (with help) to port it 
to c#. No longer will be victims of the third-party companies that have
a "special" relationship with Avaya API's.

NOTE: This is NOT an API, but rather a glorified, invisable screen-
scapper that works rather nicely.
